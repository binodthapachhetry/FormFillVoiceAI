# FormFillVoiceAI

A desktop application for converting voice notes into healthcare form entries using AI in a secure and reliable manner.

## Project Overview

FormFillVoiceAI streamlines healthcare documentation by automatically transcribing voice notes and intelligently populating healthcare forms. The application leverages speech-to-text technology, large language models for entity recognition, and computer vision foundation models to automate form filling while maintaining security and compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Architecture Design
- [ ] Define system architecture and component interactions
- [ ] Establish security protocols for handling PHI (Protected Health Information)
- [ ] Design database schema for storing form templates and user preferences
- [ ] Create wireframes for the desktop application UI
- [ ] Set up development environment and project structure
- [ ] Define API contracts between components

### Phase 2: Speech-to-Text Implementation
- [ ] Research and select appropriate STT technology (e.g., Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text)
- [ ] Implement audio recording functionality
- [ ] Develop speech-to-text conversion pipeline
- [ ] Create audio preprocessing for improved transcription accuracy
- [ ] Build caching mechanism for transcriptions
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed transcriptions

### Phase 3: Entity Recognition with LLMs
- [ ] Design prompt engineering system for healthcare context
- [ ] Implement entity extraction from transcribed text
- [ ] Develop context-aware processing using form templates
- [ ] Create mapping between extracted entities and form fields
- [ ] Build validation system for extracted information
- [ ] Implement confidence scoring for extracted entities

### Phase 4: Form Filling Automation
- [ ] Implement form template management system
- [ ] Develop computer vision model integration for form recognition
- [ ] Create form field detection and classification
- [ ] Build automated form filling engine
- [ ] Implement review and correction interface
- [ ] Develop export functionality for completed forms

### Phase 5: Security and Compliance
- [ ] Implement end-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit
- [ ] Develop audit logging for all system operations
- [ ] Create user authentication and authorization system
- [ ] Implement HIPAA-compliant data handling procedures
- [ ] Develop data retention and deletion policies
- [ ] Create privacy policy and terms of service documentation

### Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Develop comprehensive test suite for all components
- [ ] Perform security penetration testing
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing with healthcare professionals
- [ ] Optimize performance for large audio files and complex forms
- [ ] Validate accuracy of form filling across different form types
- [ ] Conduct compliance review with healthcare regulations

### Phase 7: Deployment and Documentation
- [ ] Create installation package for multiple operating systems
- [ ] Develop comprehensive user documentation
- [ ] Create administrator guide for system configuration
- [ ] Implement automatic update mechanism
- [ ] Develop onboarding tutorials for new users
- [ ] Create technical documentation for future maintenance

## Technical Stack (Proposed)

- **Frontend**: Electron.js with React/Vue for cross-platform desktop application
- **Backend**: Python for AI/ML processing, Node.js for application logic
- **Speech-to-Text**: OpenAI Whisper or similar local STT model
- **Entity Recognition**: Fine-tuned LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 2, Mistral)
- **Form Processing**: Foundation models for document understanding
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage with encryption
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption, secure authentication
